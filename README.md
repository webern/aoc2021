# Advent of Code 2021

This is the first time I have tried this.
I'm doing this in Rust.
Today is day 2, we'll see how long I can keep up.

### Day 5

Uh oh, today is the December 6th but I'm working on day 5.
I'm falling behind.
Part 1 took a while and is probably inefficient (it creates a grid like the example);

Uh oh, I just finished Day 5 Part 2 and now it's December 7th.
No time to clean it up, must press on ðŸ˜….
